            My name is Jaron Landeen, I am 24 years old. I am the second youngest in my family, I have 3 bothers and 1
            sister. I had the opportunity to live in Sweden for two years, in which I was able to pick up the Swedish
            language. I have been married for just over two years, and we are expecting our first child in
            January. I enjoy playing soccer, basketball, and video games. I also enjoy hiking and shooting or just
            spending
            my time outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently work at a small company called Western States Cabling. I am a soldering technician, where we
            assemble cables for GPS machinery equipment. I used to work as an electrician's apprentice. I'm now
            attending
            the coding bootcamp through the University of Utah, so I can improve my computer skills, and eventually
            get into a career. I would like to be able to have a company of my own, in which I would be using
            coding for the product I wish to create.
